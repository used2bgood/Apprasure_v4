    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What is appraisal in an insurance claim?</summary>
      <p>When you and your insurer can‚Äôt agree on the amount of loss, each side selects an independent appraiser. The appraisers review the claim, gather evidence, and if needed involve a neutral umpire. It‚Äôs built to be fair, impartial, and faster than litigation.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Does appraisal decide coverage?</summary>
      <p>No‚Äîappraisal determines how much the loss is, not whether it‚Äôs covered. If there‚Äôs a coverage dispute, involve a licensed public adjuster before invoking appraisal.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How long does it take?</summary>
      <p>It varies by complexity and scheduling, but the structured process moves claims forward faster than open-ended negotiations.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
