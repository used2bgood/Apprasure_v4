<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
<section id="how-it-works" class="section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section-title">How the Appraisal Process Works</h2>
    <p class="lead">When price is the dispute, appraisal provides a neutral, structured path to resolution.</p>

    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step-card">
        <div class="step-index">1</div>
        <h3>Trigger</h3>
        <p>You (the insured) invoke appraisal per the policy. Each side selects a qualified appraiser.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <div class="step-index">2</div>
        <h3>Appraisers</h3>
        <p>Appraisers inspect, compare scopes, and exchange positions using evidence and current pricing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <div class="step-index">3</div>
        <h3>Award</h3>
        <p>An umpire is selected if needed. Two of three signatures set the binding amount of loss.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Is appraisal the same as a public adjuster?</summary>
      <p>No—appraisal determines the amount of loss. It doesn’t decide coverage. A public adjuster represents you on coverage and settlement; appraisal is a dispute-resolution clause focused on price.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How long does it take?</summary>
      <p>It varies by complexity and scheduling. The structured, deadline-driven process typically moves claims faster than open-ended negotiations.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
