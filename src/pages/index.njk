  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section-title">How the Appraisal Process Works</h2>
    <p class="lead">When price is the dispute, appraisal provides a neutral, structured path to resolution.</p>

      <article class="step-card">
        <div class="step-index">1</div>
        <h3>Identify the Dispute</h3>
        <p>You and your insurer disagree on scope or price. Appraisal resolves the differences regarding the <em>amount of loss</em>—that’s it.</p>

        <h3>Each Side Picks an Appraiser</h3>
        <p>Both parties select a qualified appraiser. We act as your independent expert to evaluate scope and pricing.</p>

        <div class="step-index">3</div>
        <h3>Claim Review</h3>
        <p>Your appraiser reviews all claim documents, inspections, and photos, and gathers any additional information or expert reports needed to support an accurate valuation.</p>

        <h3>Agree or Go to an Umpire</h3>
        <p>Appraisers compare findings and work together to determine the proper value of the project. If they can’t agree, a neutral umpire is chosen to make the final call.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Is appraisal the same as a public adjuster?</summary>
      <p>No&mdash;appraisal determines the amount of loss. It doesn&rsquo;t decide coverage. A public adjuster represents you on coverage and settlement; appraisal is a dispute-resolution clause focused on price.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How long does it take?</summary>
      <p>It varies by complexity and scheduling. The structured, deadline-driven process typically moves claims faster than open-ended negotiations.</p>
